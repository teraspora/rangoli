# Rangoli Patterns

Traditional Indian Rangoli patterns overlaid on a changing colour background made by a fragment shader running on your GPU, written in GLSL and using trigonometric functions to create shapes that mutate with time.

Tools used:

- GIMP to bucket-fill regions with black
- Imagemagick to make white areas transparent
- GLSL to code the fragment shader
- the Javascript WebGL API to control shaders in the browser
